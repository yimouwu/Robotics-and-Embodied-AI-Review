Message from Zhong Fangxun: 2D Simulation of different types of robot manipulators and their motion properties. Please use MATLAB 2023a or later version to open the script. No other libraries or add-ons need to be installed.  RR2DRobotSim1/2/3.m are all main program scripts. Unzip the files into one folder, and run one of the main programs and you are good to go. Ideally, a figure window will jump out and the simulation starts automatically. Use your mouse to click on the figure to generate goal position for the robot manipulator. Fangxun owns credit for the codes.
